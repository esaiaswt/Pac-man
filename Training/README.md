## 🎮 About the PAC-MAN Project

This curriculum is built around a fully functional Pac-Man game featuring:
- Classic maze layout and gameplay
- 4 ghosts with unique AI behaviors
- Retro arcade aesthetics with neon effects
- Dynamic audio using Web Audio API
- Lives system, scoring, and level progression

The game is intentionally built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks) to provide the clearest learning experience.

## 💡 Learning Tips

1. **Type, don't copy-paste**: Writing code by hand builds muscle memory
2. **Experiment freely**: Breaking things is part of learning
3. **Use browser DevTools**: Inspect elements and debug JavaScript
4. **Ask questions**: No question is too simple
5. **Build projects**: Apply concepts to your own game ideas
6. **Stay curious**: Explore "why" something works, not just "how"

## 🏆 Certification & Next Steps

After completing this curriculum, students will have:
- A portfolio project (modified Pac-Man game)
- Strong foundation in web development
- Understanding of game programming concepts
- Skills to build their own web applications

### Recommended Next Steps:
- Build an original game from scratch
- Learn modern frameworks (React, Vue, or Svelte)
- Explore backend development (Node.js, databases)
- Contribute to open-source projects
- Take advanced game development courses

## 📞 Support & Resources

- **Documentation**: [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/)
- **Community**: Stack Overflow, Reddit's r/learnprogramming
- **Practice**: CodePen, JSFiddle for quick experiments
- **Inspiration**: Browse game dev projects on GitHub
