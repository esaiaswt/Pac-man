## Usage Guidelines

### For Students
- **Try first, check later**: Attempt all exercises before consulting answers
- **Understand, don't memorize**: Focus on understanding why the answer works
- **Multiple solutions**: Remember that there are often many correct ways to solve a problem
- **Ask questions**: If you don't understand an answer, ask your instructor

### For Instructors
- Use as grading reference
- Modify answers to match your teaching style
- Accept equivalent solutions from students
- Encourage students to find creative alternatives

## Note on Code Solutions

Many exercises have multiple valid solutions. The answer keys provide **one correct approach**, but students may have different (equally valid) solutions. Evaluate based on:

1. **Correctness**: Does it work?
2. **Understanding**: Does the student understand why?
3. **Best practices**: Does it follow conventions?
4. **Creativity**: Is it an innovative solution?

**Current Status**: Module 1 answers complete. Additional modules' answer keys can be created as needed based on specific student solutions and common patterns observed during instruction.
